# Initial Hypothesis Document (Concept Document skeleton)

Document size: 2-5 pages. When converted to the Concept Document - 5-10 pages.

## 1. Problem Statement
- **What is the problem?** Describe the core problem or opportunity you are addressing.
- **Who does it affect?** Briefly introduce the primary users or customers experiencing this problem.
- **What is the impact of the problem?** Explain the consequences of this problem (e.g., wasted time, lost revenue, user frustration).

## 2. Solution Hypothesis
- **What is our proposed solution?** Describe your product or service at a high level.
- **How does it solve the problem?** Explain the key features or mechanisms through which your solution addresses the problem statement.
- **What is the core value proposition?** What is the primary benefit users will get from your solution?

## 3. Target Audience
- **Primary Audience:** Describe the ideal customer profile for your solution. Include demographics, behaviors, and needs.
- **Secondary Audience (if any):** List other user groups who might benefit from the solution.

## 4. Initial Business Model & Monetization Hypothesis
- **How might we charge for this solution?** (e.g., subscription, one-time fee, freemium, usage-based).
- **Who is the paying customer?** (Is it the user, their manager, the company?).

## 5. Initial Go-to-Market Hypothesis

- **What is the core message for acquisition?** (e.g., a simple tagline or value proposition for marketing).

## 6. Key Assumptions to be Tested
- **Problem Assumptions:** What assumptions are we making about the problem's severity and prevalence?
- **Solution Assumptions:** What assumptions are we making about the solution's effectiveness and desirability?
- **Market Assumptions:** What assumptions are we making about the market's willingness to adopt or pay for the solution?
- **Monetization Assumptions:** What assumptions are we making about the customer's willingness to pay for the proposed solution at the hypothesized price?
- **Acquisition Assumptions:** What assumptions are we making about the effectiveness of the proposed channels to reach the target audience?
