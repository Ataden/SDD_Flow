# Customer Interview Insights & Questionnaire

*This template serves as a guide for conducting problem/solution interviews with potential customers or Product Partners. The goal is to understand their world, validate the problem, and get feedback on the proposed solution concept.*

---

## Part 1: Introduction & Warm-up (5 mins)
*Goal: Build rapport and set the context.*

- [ ] **Introduction:** Introduce yourself and the purpose of the conversation (e.g., "We're exploring a new concept to help [target audience] with [problem area] and would love your feedback.").
- [ ] **Permission to Record:** "Would you be comfortable if I recorded this session for note-taking purposes?"
- [ ] **Context Setting:** "There are no right or wrong answers; we're just looking for your honest thoughts."
- [ ] **Initial Questions:**
    - "Can you tell me a bit about your role and what a typical day looks like for you?"
    - "What are your main goals or responsibilities in your role?"

## Part 2: Problem Discovery (15-20 mins)
*Goal: Deeply understand the user's problem and current workflow without mentioning your solution.*

- [ ] **Explore the Problem Space:**
    - "Tell me about the last time you had to [perform task related to the problem]."
    - "What was the hardest or most frustrating part of that?"
    - "What makes it so challenging?"
- [ ] **Understand Current Solutions/Workarounds:**
    - "How do you currently solve this problem?"
    - "What tools or methods do you use?"
    - "What do you like and dislike about this approach?"
- [ ] **Quantify the Pain:**
    - "How much time do you spend on this?"
    - "What are the consequences if this goes wrong?"
    - "If you had a magic wand to fix anything about this process, what would it be?"

## Part 3: Solution Validation (10-15 mins)
*Goal: Introduce your concept and get initial feedback on its value.*

- [ ] **Introduce the Concept & Demonstrate Prototype (if available):**
    - "Based on what we've discussed, we've been exploring a concept to help with this. Can I show you what we're thinking?"
    - If a prototype exists: "To make that more concrete, here is a simple prototype showing how it could work. Please think out loud as you interact with it."
    - *Observe their interaction and listen for spontaneous feedback before asking direct questions.*
- [ ] **Gauge Initial Reaction:**
    - "What are your initial thoughts on this?"
    - "How would something like this fit into your current workflow?"
    - "What is most compelling about this to you?"
    - "What, if anything, is confusing or concerning?"
- [ ] **Validate the Value Proposition:**
    - "How much of an improvement would this be over your current solution?"
    - "Is this something you could see yourself using?"
    - "What would be the biggest benefit for you?"

## Part 4: Wrap-up & Next Steps (5 mins)
*Goal: Thank the participant and outline what's next.*

- [ ] **Closing Questions:**
    - "Is there anything else you think we should know?"
    - "Do you know anyone else who might be good to talk to about this?"
- [ ] **Express Gratitude:** "Thank you so much for your time and feedback. This has been incredibly helpful."
- [ ] **Outline Next Steps:** "We're still in the early stages, but would you be open to being kept in the loop as we make progress?"
