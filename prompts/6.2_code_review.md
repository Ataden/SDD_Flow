<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>

Read carefully TDD documents:
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design.md`, 
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design_data_models_schemas.md`, 
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design_api_endpoints.md` and think before you start. 

You are tasked with reviewing code implementations for the current step, see the Implementation Report in `docs/Phase<phase_number>/Steps/<step_number>/6.2_code_implementation_report.md`. As a result you have to create a review report in `docs/Phase<phase_number>/Steps/<step_number>/6.2_code_review_report.md`.

Your review should be thorough, constructive, and focused on ensuring the code meets the highest standards of quality and maintainability.

<GENERAL_GUIDELINES>

Review Guidelines:
1. **Code Quality Assessment**
   - Verify implementation matches the technical design and requirements
   - Check for code smells, anti-patterns, and potential bugs
   - Evaluate error handling and edge case coverage
   - Assess code organization and structure

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Identify potential performance bottlenecks
   - Check for inefficient algorithms or data structures
   - Review database queries and API calls for optimization opportunities

3. **Security Review**
   - Check for common security vulnerabilities
   - Verify input validation and sanitization
   - Assess authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Review error handling to prevent information leakage

4. **Testing Coverage**
   - Evaluate unit test coverage and quality
   - Verify integration tests for critical paths
   - Check for proper test data management

5. **Documentation**
   - Review code comments and documentation
   - Verify API documentation completeness
   - Check for updated architectural diagrams if applicable

6. **Best Practices**
   - Enforce coding standards and style guidelines
   - Verify proper use of design patterns
   - Check for code duplication and opportunities for refactoring
   - Assess dependency management

## Review Process
1. Analyze the implementation against the requirements
2. Document findings with clear severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Provide specific, actionable feedback
4. Suggest improvements with code examples when applicable
5. Verify all edge cases are handled
6. Check for proper error handling and logging

## Deliverables
- A comprehensive review report in `docs/Phase<phase_number>/Steps/<step_number>/6.2_code_review_report.md`
- List of critical issues requiring immediate attention
- Suggestions for improvements and optimizations
- Security recommendations
- Testing gaps and recommendations

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Code follows the implementation plan
- [ ] All requirements are properly implemented
- [ ] Code is clean, readable, and maintainable
- [ ] Proper error handling is in place
- [ ] Performance considerations are addressed
- [ ] Security best practices are followed
- [ ] Tests are comprehensive and pass
- [ ] Documentation is complete and up-to-date
- [ ] Code style is consistent with the project guidelines

## Notes
- Be specific and provide examples when pointing out issues
- Balance criticism with positive feedback
- Consider the context and constraints of the implementation
- Focus on both functional and non-functional requirements
- Verify backward compatibility if applicable
