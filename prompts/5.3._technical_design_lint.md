# Review the consistency of the TDD and codebase

Read carefully TDD documents:
   - `docs/5.3_technical_design.md`, 
   - (if exists) `docs/5.3_technical_design_data_models_schemas.md`, 
   - (if exists) `docs/5.3_technical_design_api_endpoints.md`
You have to find all inconsistencies in the TDD and fix them. You must ensure that TDD and codebase are coherent, correct and absolutely impeccable. It must contain no descrepancies, be free of any errors and have no any statements that would require any clarification before passing to the code implementation step.

Implement the tasks #ARGUMENTS of these (WARN! pay attention only to the Task #ARGUMENTS) :

## Task 1 - Components of the system

### Naming and IDs consistency
Look at each component in Section 2. Component Architecture one-by-one (use a checklist) and check if the IDs and names are used consistently throughout the whole TDD.

Take into account the following naming and ID rules:
Components codes:
```
F - Frontend (example: F1.UserProfile)
B - Backend  (example: B1.AuthService)
D - Data Layer 
E - External Services
```
### Consistency with codebase
After you make sure in the internal consistency within TDD, you have to look through the whole codebase and find any component names are not consistent with the TDD. Remove any descrepancy in code and comments with the TDD.

## Task 2 - Interactions and Data Contracts

### Naming and IDs consistency
Look at each interaction between components in Section 3. Data Models & Schemas one-by-one (use a checklist) and check if the IDs and names on the interaction and data contracts are used consistently throughout the whole TDD.

Interactions and Data Contracts codes:
```
I - Interaction (e.g., I1, I2, etc.)
DC - Data Contract, naming: DC<interaction_number>-<contract_number>.<name> - data contract <name> for interaction <interaction_number> and contract <contract_number> . Example: DC1-1.LoginRequest (data contract 1 for interaction 1)
```
### Consistency with codebase
After you make sure in the internal consistency within TDD, you have to look through the whole codebase and find any interaction and data contract names are not consistent with the TDD. Remove any descrepancy in code and comments with the TDD.

## Task 3 - API Endpoints consistency
Look at each internal API endpoint in Section 4. API Endpoints one-by-one (use a checklist) and check if the API endpoints are used consistently throughout the whole TDD. Make sure that data contracts referenced in the API endpoints are consistent with the section `3. Data Models & Schemas`.

After you make sure in the internal consistency within TDD, you have to look through the whole codebase and find any API endpoint that are not consistent with the TDD. Remove any descrepancy in code and comments with the TDD.

## Final Report 
After you have fixed all inconsistencies in the TDD, create a final report in the file `docs/reports/5.3_technical_design_lint_report.md` (append if exists) describe all the work you have done, list all the components, interactions, data contracts and API endpoints you checked, inconsistencies you have found and fixed.
