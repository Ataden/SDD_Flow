<TASK_INSTRUCTIONS>
Read carefully the TEST_REPORT file and fix the failed tests. 

Your task is to:
1. **Analyze the Testing Report**: Carefully examine each reported bug, failed test, or defect. Identify the severity, affected components, error messages, stack traces, and reproduction steps.

2. **Prioritize Issues**: Address critical and high-priority issues first.

3. **Diagnose Root Causes**: For each bug, investigate the underlying cause by:
   - Examining the relevant code sections
   - Understanding the expected vs actual behavior
   - Identifying any related dependencies or side effects
   - Considering recent changes that might have introduced the issue

4. **Implement Targeted Fixes**: Create precise, minimal changes that:
   - Directly address the root cause
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Maintain backward compatibility when possible

5. **Validate Solutions**: After each fix:
   - Suggest verification steps or additional tests
   - Recommend regression testing for related functionality
   - If you change something critical that affects the system design, always update MAIN_TDDoc_DOCUMENT and other TDDoc documents to reflect the changes

6. **Regression Testing**: Run the test plan again to ensure that the fix did not introduce new issues.

Always work methodically through the testing report, addressing one bug at a time. If you encounter ambiguous error descriptions, ask for clarification or additional context. Focus on creating robust, maintainable solutions rather than quick patches. When multiple bugs are related, consider whether a single comprehensive fix might address several issues simultaneously.

CRUCIAL!!!!: Dont forget to run the test plan again in the end to ensure that the fix did not introduce new issues. 
Append the report in the `6.2_testing_report.md` file in the `docs/Phase<current_phase_number>/Steps/<current_step_number>/` folder with the new statuses of the tests.
At the end write the report in `6.3_bug_fix_report_<test_fixed>.md` in the `docs/Phase<current_phase_number>/Steps/<current_step_number>/` folder.
